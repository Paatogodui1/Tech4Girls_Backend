File ownership in Linux is a concept that defines who has control over a file or directory. These owners are the owner, group and others.
The permissions (modes):
Read (r): Allows the content of the file or directory to be read. represented by a numeric mode 4.
Write (w): Allows the file or directory to be modified or deleted. represented by a numeric mode 2.
Execute (x): Allows the file or directory to be executed as a program or script. represented by a numeric mode 1.
To check the permissions of a file or directory, use the "ls -l" command.
The permissions are dispaled in three notations.
To add a permission to a file or directory use the chmod command: chmod <type of owner> + <permission>
To remove a permission , use: chmod <type of owner> - <permission>
To use the numeric mode, the chmod command can be used too: <***> where the first digit reresents permissions for the onwer , the second for the group and the third for others.
